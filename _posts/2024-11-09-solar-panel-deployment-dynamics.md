  This research focuses on the dynamics analysis of a torsion spring-actuated solar panel deployment system with a hard-stop mechanism in a PocketQube satellite. As the panel is deployed, it rotates 135 degees before hitting the stopper and starts vibrating for a brief amount of time as it hits the stopper before coming at rest. Using numerical simulation, the torques involved in the deployment were modelled, including spring torque, static and dynamic friction torques, and impact torque to calculate the motion and velocity of the panel before it comes to rest. The study was validated by performing an experiment which uses IMU sensor to measure the angular displacement of the panel during the deployment test. The results suggest that the numerical model developed in the study is reliable to calculate the deployment dynamics of a spring actuated solar panel.
