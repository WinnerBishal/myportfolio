### Design and Implementation of a Vision Integrated Delta Robot for Pick and Place Operations

## Abstract
This paper discusses the design, implementation
and experimental validation of a vision integrated delta robot
capable of autonomous pick and place operations. The robot has
been designed and fabricated from the ground up, incorporating
technologies such as 3D printing and precision cutting. The robot
uses three stepper motors to control the arms and a vacuum
gripper is provided at the end effector to pick objects. The robot
is also equipped with a computer vision system that detects
and classifies objects in real time. The automation is handled
by robot operating system in conjunction with an arduino
microcontroller. This paper also elucidates the path planning
and trajectory generation implemented in the robot and the
software implementation of the system. The outcome of the paper
is the experimental validation of the planning algorithms and
kinematics developed and successfully tested through automatic
pick and place task.
