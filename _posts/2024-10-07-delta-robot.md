  This paper discusses the design, implementation and experimental validation of a vision integrated delta robot capable of autonomous pick and place operations. The robot has been designed and fabricated from the ground up, incorporating technologies such as 3D printing and precision cutting. The robot uses three stepper motors to control the arms and a vacuum gripper is provided at the end effector to pick objects. The robot is also equipped with a computer vision system that detects and classifies objects in real time. The automation is handled by robot operating system in conjunction with an arduino microcontroller. This paper also elucidates the path planning and trajectory generation implemented in the robot and the software implementation of the system. The outcome of the paper is the experimental validation of the planning algorithms and kinematics developed and successfully tested through automatic pick and place task.
